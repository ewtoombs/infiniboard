## Not your Dad's blackboard.

*The blackboard's surface grows exponentially with distance from the centre,
instead of the usual linear growth.* (Specifically, the blackboard's surface is
a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with uniform negative curvature.  It is
rendered conformally as a Poincar√© disk.) This allows for the drawing of trees,
graphs, and other novel . . . things that would not be possible on a regular
blackboard.

*Everything you have ever drawn on the infiniboard will be visible, at least at
some zoom level.* As the blackboard is panned, objects in the centre get
smaller as they approach the edge, and objects at the edge get larger as they
approach the centre.

*Responsiveness over prettiness.* This is supposed to be a tool for
communication and problem solving in real time, just like a real blackboard.
Great care has been taken to ensure the blackboard is as responsive as humanly
or machinely possible, even on really old hardware. The computer I'm currently
testing on only supports OpenGL 2.1, to give you an idea.

Besides that, it's really just a regular blackboard.

## It's not ready yet! Don't eat it! Get out of the kitchen!

Right now, it's just a pannable background. Drawing has not been implemented
yet. This is next on my todo list.
