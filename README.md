## Not your Dad's blackboard.

*The blackboard's surface grows exponentially in with distance from the centre,
instead of the usual linear growth.* (Specifically, the blackboard's surface is
a 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold with uniform negative curvature.  It is
rendered conformally as a Poincar√© disk.) This allows for the drawing of trees,
graphs, and other novel . . . things that would not be possible on a regular
blackboard.

*Everything you have ever drawn on the infiniboard will be visible, at least at
some zoom level.* As the blackboard is panned, objects in the centre get
smaller as they approach the edge, and objects at the edge get larger as they
approach the centre.

*Responsiveness over prettiness.* Great care has been taken to ensure the
blackboard is as responsive as humanly or machinely possible, even on really
old hardware.

Besides that, it's really just a regular blackboard.
